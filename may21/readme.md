# 📊 Data Analysis Pipeline — May 21

## 🗓️ Date
May 21

## 🚀 Main Task
Build a multi-agent system that performs data analysis from CSV files using asynchronous coordination between agents and LLM capabilities.

---

## 🧠 Agents Involved
- **DataFetcher**: Responsible for retrieving and loading CSV data.
- **Analyst**: Performs data manipulation and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** for generating insightful visualizations.
- **Gemini LLM** as the backend for code generation and reasoning.
- **Autogen** for building multi-agent workflows.
- **Async functions** for non-blocking agent coordination.
- **RoundRobinGroupChat** or **SelectorGroupChat** for agent messaging.

---

## 📌 Features
- Automatically fetches and loads a CSV file.
- Analyzes data using Pandas (filtering, summarizing, etc.).
- Creates visualizations with Matplotlib (bar, line, histogram, etc.).
- Operates asynchronously for improved performance.
- Uses Gemini LLM to empower each agent with reasoning and dynamic code generation.
